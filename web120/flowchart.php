 <p>My name is Nicolet (Nic for short) Satran. I grew up in the Midwest, in Eagle River, Wisconsin. I moved to Washington almost 3 years ago, specifically Bellingham, Washington. In the past 3 years in Washington, I have lived in Friday Harbor (on San Juan Island), Bellingham, Glacier, and currently, Seattle. I moved to Seattle to attend college at Seattle Central College. I am enrolled in the programming program and I am determined to finish that certificate as well as continue on to North Seattle College for Software Development in a couple years.</p>
